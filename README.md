# Editor-NET-1.5.6
Push code base to Github to tap into it from various locations

This code base does one task rather well.  It presents a database table on a webpage with minimal efforts.  

User simply needs to provide database type and the database connection string in the sln file settings and change a few variables 
in the .js and .cs and viola you have a table presented on the web. 

Highly extensible and Customizable.  The code base in this repository includes license Editor code base, which is the server-side code
along with the js files needed to support table inline editing.
